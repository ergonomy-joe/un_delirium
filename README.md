# un_delirium

This is the result of the decompilation of the executable DELIRIUM.EXE from the game "Escape From Delirium".

You will need an msdos environment (DosBox works well), 
Microsoft Macro Assembler (masm) version 5.10
and version 6.0 of the Borland Turbo Pascal Compiler.

Two "libraries" from borland must be copied directly to the source folder
 GRAPH.TPU
 TURBO.TPL

the version you found may differ from the one originaly used for the build. If this is the case, I may try to find a way to "upload" the correct ones somewhere; let me know.

just launch the DOIT.BAT batch file to build a MAIN.EXE that, if everything runs smoothly, should be identical to DELIRIUM.EXE.

have fun,
